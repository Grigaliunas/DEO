# DEO
Digital Evidence Object
In cybercrime investigation, theoretical methodology and practical tools have become two essential technologies. Theoretical methodologies define the models to investigate the cybercrime, and practical tools crime. Known models integrate knowledge of experts from the fields of digital forensics and software development, use events reconstruction, automatic knowledge extraction, and preservation of data integrity. The aim of our research is to propose digital evidence object model that combines the crime investigation process with the object-oriented programming model informatively. We propose a novel Digital Evidence Object (DEO) Model that is defined as 

DEO=(W_hy,W_hen,W_here,W_hat,W_ho ) 

The proposed model provides a methodology for digital investigation minimizing investigation cost and time. The DEO model can be directly mapped into a tool, applicable to investigate the various type of cybercrime.
The main purpose of the digital forensic investigation in our experiment is to provide a valid and reliable evaluation of proposed model for digital evidence investigation using habits attribution profiling method (HiD) and proposed digital evidence object model (DEO). To achieve evaluation result Digital Evidence Investigation of Cybercrime (DEIC) tool was developed to perform this task.
